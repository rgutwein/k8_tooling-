# V-242390 The Kubernetes API server must have anonymous authentication disabled.
## Discussion
The kubernetes API server controls kubernetes via an API interface. A user who has access to the API essentially has root access to the entire k8 cluster. To control access, users must be authenticated and authorized. By allowing anonymous connections, the controls puts in place to secure the API can be bypassed.
Setting anonymous authentication to ```false``` also disabled unauthenticated requests from kubelets.
While there are instances where anonymous connections may be needed (health checks) and RBAC are in place to limit the anonymous access, this access should be disabled, and only enabled when necessary.
## Check Text
Change to the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests``` directory on the kubernetes master node, run the following command:
```grep -i anonymous-auth```
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kubernetes API Server manifest file in the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests``` directory on the kubernetes master node. 
- [x] Set the argument ```--anonymous-auth``` to ```false```
