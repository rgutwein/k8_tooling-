# V-242434 The Kubernetes Kubelet must enable kernel protection
## Discussion
System kernel is responsible for memory, disk, and task management. The kernel provides a gateway between the system hardware and software. Kubernetes requires kernel access to allocate resources to the Control Plane. Threat actors that penetrate the system kernel can inject malicious code or hijack the Kubernetes architecture. It is vital to implement protections through Kubernetes components to reduce the attack surface.
## Check Text
Change to the ```/etc/sysconfig/``` directory on the kubernetes master node, run the command: ```grep -i protect-kernel-defaults kubelet```
If the setting ```protect-kernel-defaults``` os set tp ```false``` or not set in the kubernetes kubelet, this is a finding.
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kubernetes kubelet file in the ```/etc/sysconfig/``` directory on the kubernetes master node
- [x] Set the argument ```protect-kernel-defaults``` to ```true```
- [x] Reset the kubelet service: ```service kubelet restart```
