# V-245542 Kubernetes API Server must disable basic authentication to protect information in transit.
## Discussion
Kubernetes basic authentication sends and receives request containing ``username```, ```uid```, ```groups```, and other fields over a clear text HTTP communication. Basic authentication does not provide any security mechanisms using encryption standards. PKI certificate-based authentication must be set over a secure channel to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Basic authentication must not be set in the manifest file.
## Check Text
Within ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests/``` directory on the kubernetes master node, run the command:
```grep -i basic-auth-file *```
If ```basic-auth-file``` is set in the kubernetes API server manifest file, this is a finding. 
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kubernetes API Server manifest in the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests/``` directory on the kubernetes master node
- [x] Remove the setting ```basic-auth-file```
