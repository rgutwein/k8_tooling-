# V-242397 The Kubernetes Kubelet static PodPath must not enable static pods
## Discussion
Allowing kubelet to set a ```staticPodPath``` gives containers with root access permissions to traverse the hosting filesystem. The danger comes when the container can create a manifest file within the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests``` directory. When a manifest is created within this directory, containers are entirely governed by the Kubelet not the API Server. The container is not susceptible to admission control at all. Any containers or pods that are instantiated in this manner are called ```static pods``` and are meant to be used for pods such as the ```API server```, ```scheduler```, ```controller```, etc., not workload pods that need to be governed by the API Server.
## Check Text
On the master and worker nodes, change to the ```/etc/sysconfig/``` and run the command ```grep -i staticPodPath kubelet```
If any of the nodes return a value for ```staticPodPath```, this is a finding.
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kubernetes kubelet file in the ```/etc/sysconfig/``` directory to remove the ```staticPodPath``` setting
- [x] Restart kubelet service: ```service kubelet restart```
