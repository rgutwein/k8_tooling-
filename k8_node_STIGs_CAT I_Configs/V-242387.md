# V-242387 The Kubernetes Kubelet must have the read-only port flag disabled
## Discussion
Kubelet services as small REST API with read access to port 10255. The read-only port for kubernetes provides no authentication or authorization security control. Providing unrestricted access on port 0255 exposes kubernetes pods and containers to malicious attacks or compromise. Port 10255 is deprecated and should be disabled.
## Check Text
Run the following on each worker node and on master node:
``` ps -ef | grep kubelet ```
If the ```--read-only-port ```argument does not exist on worker nodes and master node, this is a finding.
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kubelet file in the ```--config ```directory on the kubernetes master node. 
- [x] Set the argument ```--read-only-port``` to "0"
- [x] Reset kubelet service: ```service kubelet restart```
- [x] IF using worker node arguments, edit the kubelet service file /usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet_service.d/10-kubeadm.conf on each Worker Node: set the parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable to ```--read-only-port=0```
