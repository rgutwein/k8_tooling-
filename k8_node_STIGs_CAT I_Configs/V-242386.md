# V-242386 The Kubernetes API server must have the insecure port flag disabled
## Discussion
By default, The API server will listen on two ports. One port is the secure port and the other is called the "localhost port". This is port 8080. Any requests to this port bypass authentication and authorization checks. If this port is left open, anyone who gains access to the host on which the master is running can bypass all authorization and authentication mechanisms put in place, and have full control over the entire cluster. Close the insecure port by setting the API server's --insecure-port flag to "0", ensuring that the --insecure-bind-address is not set.
## Check Text
Within ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests/``` directory on the kubernetes master node and run the following command:
``` grep -i insecure-port *```
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kuberenetes API server manifest file in the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests``` directory
- [x] Set the argument ```--insecure-port to "0"```
