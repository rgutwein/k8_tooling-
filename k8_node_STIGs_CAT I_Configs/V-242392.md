# V-242392 The Kubernetes Kubelet must enable explicit authorization
## Discussion
Kubelet is the primary agent on each node. The API server communicates with each kubelet to perform tasks such as starting/stopping pods. By default, kubelets allows all authenticated requests, even anonymous ones, without requiring any authorization checks from the API server. This default behavior bypasses authorization controls put in place to limit what users may perform within the kubernetes cluster. To change this behavior, the default setting of ```AlwaysAllow``` for the authorization mode must be set to ```Webhook```
## Check Text
Change to the ```/etc/sysconfig/``` directory on the kubernetes master node: ```grep -i authorization-mode kubelet```
If the authorization-mode is missing or is set to ```AlwaysAllow``` on the master node or any of the worker nodes, this is a finding.
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kubernetes kubelet file in the ```/etc/sysconfig/``` directory on the kubernetes master and worker nodes.
- [x] Set the argument ```--authorization-mode``` to ```Webhook```
- [x] Restart kubelet service: ```service kubelet restart```
