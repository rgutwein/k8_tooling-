# V-242381: The Kubernetes Controller Manager must create unique service accounts for each work payload.
## Discussion
The Kubernetes Controller Manager is a background process that embeds core control loops regulating cluster system state through the API Servere. Every process executed in a pod has an associated service account. 
By default, service accounts use the same credentials for authentication. Implementing the default setttings poses a High risk to the Kubernetes Controller Manager.
Settomg the use-service-account value lowers the attack surface by generating unique service accounts settings for each controller instance.
## Check Text
Change to the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests/``` directory on the Kubernetes Master Node. Run the command: 
```grep -i use-service-account-credentials```. If the setting is not configured in the Kubernetes Controller Manager file or it is set to ```false```, this is a finding.
## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the Kubernetes Controller Manager manifest file in the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifest``` directory on the Kubernetes Master Node. 
- [x] Set the value of ```use-service-account-credentials``` to ```true```
