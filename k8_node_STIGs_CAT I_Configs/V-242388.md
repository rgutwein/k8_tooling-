# V-242388 The Kubernetes API server must have the insecure bind address not set
## Discussion
By default, The API server will listen on two ports and addresses. One address is the secure address and the other address is called the "insecure bind" address and is set by default to localhost. Any request to this address bypass authentication and authorization checks. 
If the insecure bind address is set to localhost, anyone who gains access to the host on which the master is running can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms put in place and ghave full control over the entire cluster.
Close or set the insecure bind address by setting the API server's ```--insecure-bind-address``` flag to an IP or leave it unset and ensure that the ```insecure-bind-port``` is not set.

## Check Text
Change to the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests``` directory on the kubernetes master node, run the command: ```grep -i insecure-bind-address *```
If the setting insecure-bind-address is found and set to ```localhost``` in the kubernetes API, this is a finding.

## Fix Text
- [x] Edit the kubernetes API server manifest file in the ```/etc/kubernetes/manifests``` directory on the kubernetes master node. 
- [x] Remove the value for the ```--insecure-bind-address``` setting.
